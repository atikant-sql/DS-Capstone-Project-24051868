De-identifying patient medical records

In this project, we have designed a method for de-identifying patient medical record numbers and clinical laboratory order numbers that could be used to automate de-identification of large multivariable data extracts in Excel spreadsheets.

Input file as of now can be csv or excel format. use the streamlit interface to select the methods for de-identifying and export the final excel file.
